	<div class="part">adj.</div>
	<div class="definition">
		Independent, irresponsible. An absolute monarchy is one
		in which the sovereign does as he pleases so long as he
		pleases the assassins. Not many absolute monarchies are
		left, most of them having been replaced by limited
		monarchies, where the sovereign's power for evil (and for
		good) is greatly curtailed, and by republics, which are
		governed by chance.
